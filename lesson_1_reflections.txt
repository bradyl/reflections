How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I was able to easily see only the places where new file had changed- like a
	magnifying glass.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    Able to remember and review changes made while editing.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    Creating logical, easily remembered save points.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Programming uses multiple files, whereas individual documents are normally
	used separately.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    Can find and compare versions of same file to find differences.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    Confident that I can precisely find and undo changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    confident, faster code production
